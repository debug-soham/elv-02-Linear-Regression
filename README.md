# Task 3: Linear Regression

This task focuses on building and evaluating a linear regression model using the California Housing dataset. The goal is to predict the median house value based on multiple features.

## 📈 Objective  
Implement and understand simple & multiple linear regression using real-world housing data.

## 🔧 Steps Performed  
- Imported and explored the dataset (`California_Housing.csv`)  
- Preprocessed data and split it into training and test sets  
- Trained a `LinearRegression` model using Scikit-learn  
- Evaluated model using **MAE**, **MSE**, and **R² score**  
- Visualized:  
  - Actual vs. Predicted values (scatter plot)  
  - Feature coefficients using a dataframe

## 📁 Files  
- `California_Housing.csv` – Raw dataset  
- `Linear_Regression_California.ipynb` – Notebook with implementation and evaluation
